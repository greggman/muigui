A simple Web UI library.

muigui is a simple UI library in the spirit of
[dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) and/or [lil-gui](https://github.com/georgealways/).

It is not a general purpose library for every type of GUI.
Rather, it is a small, easy to use library for small apps.
Basically I liked how simple it was to use dat.gui to add
a few sliders and options to a demo. What I didn't like is
that dat.gui is very opinionated on style. For example I 
wanted to be able to try to use it for forms and not always
as a drop down menu.

I thought I'd try to make a CSS/DOM based UI standard elements
only and then require CSS to style it and see how far I got.

### Not invented here syndrome

It's possible this already exists but if so I couldn't find it.
Most UI libraries seem to be giant and require a build step.
I wanted something hopefully not too big and something I could
easily add to any example with 1 file (or 2 if you add CSS).
